# CppEngine

A Deferred Rendering "engine". While I wish it was a standalone engine, it is pretty tightly tied to a specific visualization. 
I hope to decouple that soon. Was started as part of a final project for CSCI5607 in the Fall of 2018 at the University of 
Minnesota.

Make sure you change CMakeLists.txt lines 36-40 to the appropriate location of your SDL download.
