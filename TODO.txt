TODO List:
Difficulty: Small(1-3 days) --> Medium(3-7 days) --> Large(7-14 days) --> Huge(14+ days)

Memory Manager:
 Small --> Optimize what should be in our custom dynamic memory block and what shouldn't (mesh vertices probably don't need to, lights probably do, etc.)
 Medium --> Speed up allocation (slower than default allocator)

Rendering:
 Small --> Cutouts should render with deferred rendering rather than forward transparent
 Small --> Automatic calculation of Orthographic matrix for shadow maps based on scene bounds
 Medium --> Support for more lights (multiple directional light, spot light)
 Large --> Ambient Occlusion calculated and incorporated into current gbuffers (don't use more texture memory)
 Large --> Tiled-Deferred Rendering instead of deferred with light volumes
 Huge --> Translate rendering logic into Vulkan (Requires continuation of Vulkan tutorial to learn more)

Clean-up:
 Small --> Vector for each light type. No need for one generic lights array
 Small --> Get all assets in AssetManager
 Small --> Switch shader vector from vector to map or similar structure for more intuitive lookup of shaders
