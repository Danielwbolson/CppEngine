Release: Render Pass Pipeline, v1.0

Triangles drawn: 985334

Bits per pixel for deferred texturing:
RGB is not supported on my GPU which then converts them to RGBA
Position : RGB32F
- RGBA32F is 128 bits
Normal : RGB16F
- RGBA16f is 64 bits
Diffuse : RGB8
- RGBA8 is 32 bits
Specular : RGBA8
- RGBA8 is 32 bits
Depth : GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT
- Looks like this is probably 16bit

Bits per pixel for deferred texturing:
Normal : R11G11B10
- This is 32 bits and there is no forced Alpha channel
Diffuse/Specular/SpecEXP : RGBA16UI
- RGBA16 is 64 bits
Depth : GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24
- 32 bits (24 + alpha 8) so that we can do a stencil buffer eventually

Total bits: 128
